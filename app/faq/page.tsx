      question: "What is DarkNote?",
      answer: "DarkNote is a zero-knowledge encrypted messaging platform built on Solana. We enable users to send self-destructing, encrypted messages that can only be decrypted by the intended recipient's wallet. The server never has access to your message content - all encryption and decryption happens client-side using your Solana wallet's cryptographic keys."
    },
    {
      question: "How is our encryption provably fair?",
      answer: "DarkNote uses x25519 elliptic curve cryptography with ephemeral key pairs for each message. Your encryption key is deterministically derived from your Solana wallet signature, ensuring only you can decrypt messages sent to you. The encryption happens entirely in your browser - the server only stores encrypted ciphertext, nonces, and ephemeral public keys. This zero-knowledge architecture means we mathematically cannot read your messages, making our encryption provably secure and fair."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you prove you're using x25519 encryption and can't read our messages?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Our entire codebase is open source - you can verify every line of encryption code yourself. We use TweetNaCl's implementation of x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305, the same battle-tested crypto library used by Signal and other privacy-focused apps. The math is simple: breaking x25519 requires solving the discrete logarithm problem on Curve25519, which is computationally impossible even with all of Earth's computing power. Our server only stores three things: encrypted ciphertext (useless without your private key), a random nonce, and an ephemeral public key. Without your wallet's secret key derived from your signature, decryption is mathematically impossible - not just hard, but provably impossible. Check our GitHub to verify the implementation yourself."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do I need to generate a public key before I can receive messages?",
      answer: "Your encryption public key is what senders use to encrypt messages for you - it's essential for the zero-knowledge architecture. This key is deterministically derived from your Solana wallet signature, meaning only you can generate it and only you can decrypt messages encrypted with it. You only need to do this once. Without registering your public key first, senders wouldn't be able to encrypt messages in a way that only you can decrypt. Think of it like publishing a lock that only your private key can open - it enables others to send you encrypted messages without ever knowing your private key."
    },
    {
      question: "What problem are we solving?",
      answer: "Solana seems to have missed the mark so far on sending private information from person to person. Transactions aren't the only thing that should be protected. Traditional encrypted messaging platforms require trust in centralized servers, account creation, and often compromise on privacy. DarkNote solves this by leveraging blockchain wallets for identity and encryption. No accounts, no emails, no phone numbers, just wallet-to-wallet encrypted communication. Self-destruct features ensure messages don't persist forever, and our open architecture means you can verify the security yourself."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are we launching a token?",
      answer: "Launching a DarkNote token on Pump.fun provides us with immediate liquidity to build upon our current decentralized messaging system and to develop new features in the very near future. DarkNote is a three-man team of passionate developers who are keen on building the most useful privacy-friendly products on-chain, and the strongest possible way to do that is to keep the team and community aligned with a token that anyone can buy."
